Hi there!

I'm Araz Abishov, a software engineer living in Norway and working at Microsoft. I enjoy learning and playing around with the new technology, and I occasionally write about it in this blog.

If you have any questions or just want to say hi, you can reach out to me at [twitter](https://twitter.com/arazabishov).
